MALLOW:
Pirates flying a White Hourglass on their flag
attacked. They raided that old ruin up on the
mountain. Most of us got away, but...

But what?


MALLOW:
Hazel was up on the mountain collecting herbs.
The pirates threw her in a barrel and rolled
her off with whatever they took from the ruin.

They kidnapped Hazel? We have to get some
help then!

Tilia... I am the help. I'm a volunteer
navyman. It's my duty to take care of this
island. Yours too if you want to join someday.

But... you're not leaving, though. You have
to teach me how to fight monsters and
pirates! And run the tavern!
MALLOW:
I'm sorry, Little Gull. You'll be fine. They've
just sailed away. It shouldn't take me more

I'll be back home before you realize it.
You and Linden just watch the tavern for a
